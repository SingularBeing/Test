Things I accomplished:
*Path creation from mouse Input
*Storing of the mouse speed in each node
*Visualization of the mouse speed in each node with a different color
*Red ball movement along the path
*Creation of the visual of the paths
*Fully commented code

Things I failed at:
*Right now, you can only do the value of 16. Others seem to mess it up
*The magnetic bezier curve hasn't wanted to work right. I tried to make it work, but couldn't.
*The magnetic bezier curve only works on a normal right curve and sometimes on a normal left curve
*Creation of the magnetic bezier curve at the fast mouse moving locations. Right now it only is created at the base of the spline.
*The magnetic bezier curve can get enlongated or odd at weird values. 16 seems to be the 'middle-ground' of the base values
